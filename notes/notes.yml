This command allows users to interact with MariaDB databases through the command line. It provides a way to execute SQL queries, manage databases, users, and perform various administrative tasks.
    - The -e option in the mariadb command stands for "execute." It allows you to specify a single SQL statement to be executed by MariaDB immediately after connecting.
