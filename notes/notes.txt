what is mariadb:

MariaDB is like a digital filing system for organizing and storing data. It helps applications manage information efficiently, ensuring security, reliability, and easy access to data.
MariaDB helps organize your data into neat categories (called tables), making it easy to find and manage. For example, you might have a table for customer information and another for product details.

mariadb host:

if your MariaDB container is named mariadb_container, you can use mariadb_container as the database host when configuring WordPress to connect to the MariaDB container. Docker's built-in DNS resolution will resolve this name to the IP address of the MariaDB container, allowing WordPress to establish a connection to the MariaDB database server.
when running MariaDB and WordPress in separate Docker containers, you can use either the container name, service name, or IP address of the MariaDB container as the database host within the WordPress configuration.

The mariadb command is a command-line client for MariaDB, which is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) and a drop-in replacement for MySQL. This command allows users to interact with MariaDB databases through the command line. It provides a way to execute SQL queries, manage databases, users, and perform various administrative tasks.

The -e option in the mariadb command stands for "execute." It allows you to specify a single SQL statement to be executed by MariaDB immediately after connecting.

The file 50-server.cnf is typically a configuration file used by MariaDB (or MySQL) server instances. In MySQL/MariaDB, configuration files are used to specify various settings and parameters that govern the behavior of the database server.
    - SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user; (to show user)

- nginx:

what is nginx:
NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities.

Nginx is a web server software that helps deliver web pages to users when they visit a website. It's like a traffic cop for the internet, directing incoming requests to the right place and handling them quickly and efficiently.

Web servers are responsible for making your website accessible to browsers and users.


what is mkcert:
mkcert is a tool used for generating self-signed certificates for local development purposes. It simplifies the process of creating trusted certificates that can be used to secure local servers and test environments.

mkcert simplifies the process of generating trusted self-signed certificates for local development, using OpenSSL under the hood.

what are SSL and TLS:

SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over the internet, while HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that uses either SSL or TLS to encrypt data transmitted between a web server and a web browser.

- WordPress:

what is WP-CLI:

WP-CLI is the command line interface for WordPress. It is a tool that allows you to interact with your WordPress site from the command line, it is used for a lot of purposes, such as automating tasks, debugging problems, installing/removing plugins alongside themes, managing users and roles, exporting/importing data, run database queries, and so much more...

What is CGI?

CGI stands for “Common Gateway Interface.” It is a standard protocol that defines how web servers can interact with external applications or scripts to process HTTP requests and generate dynamic web content.
When a client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a web server, the server processes the request and, in the case of static content (like HTML and images), directly serves the requested file. However, when the requested content is dynamic and needs to be generated on the fly, the server can use CGI to communicate with external programs to handle the processing.

what is FastCGI?

FastCGI is a variation of the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) that addresses the performance and scalability limitations of traditional CGI. It is a protocol that allows web servers to communicate with external application processes efficiently, enabling dynamic content generation for web applications.
With traditional CGI, a new process is spawned for each request, leading to a significant performance overhead. FastCGI improves upon this by introducing a persistent application process pool that remains alive even after processing a request. This process pool eliminates the need to start a new process for each incoming request, reducing the overhead and providing better performance and resource utilization.

What is PHP-FPM?

PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an implementation of the FastCGI protocol specifically designed for use with PHP. It works by starting a pool of worker processes that are responsible for executing PHP scripts. When a web server receives a request for a PHP script, it passes the request to one of the worker processes, which then executes the script and returns the result to the web server. This allows PHP scripts to be executed more efficiently, as the worker processes can be reused for multiple requests.


In summary, CGI is the simplest and oldest method for executing server-side scripts but suffers from performance overhead. FastCGI improves upon CGI by introducing a persistent process pool, resulting in better performance. PHP-FPM, on the other hand, is a specific FastCGI implementation tailored for PHP execution, providing superior performance, scalability, and security for serving PHP applications. For modern PHP applications, PHP-FPM is the recommended method for handling dynamic content.
